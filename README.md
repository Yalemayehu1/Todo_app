#Features

# Project structure:

       * I will use bootstrap to create components and tie the application together.
       * I will use sqlite to store the information in the database.
       * I will use docker to containerize the application for rapid developement.
       * I will use pytest to test the application.
       * TBA

# Flow of the project:

        * A user goes to the website logs in. (optional)
        * cnot to create a auth feature.
        * a usre is presented with a blank todo interface (if the user is new then
          then the interface will create a new list for the user.) If not the user will resume previous session.
        * user goes to the site and interacts with the apllication.
        * the application has a list of task in  which a user can update, delete, create or read.
        * CRUD - create, read, update, delete.
